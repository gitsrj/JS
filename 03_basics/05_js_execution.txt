The code goes in the Global Execution Context, which is stored in 'this' object, which has the 'window' object in it.

After that the code goes in the 1) Memory Creation Phase, where memory is alloted to the variables and all.

Next it goes in the 2) Execution Phase, where the code gets executed.

If there is another function in the execution phase then, a Variable Execution is created along with a thread, where again 1) and
2) gets executed.


Then there is the call stack showing how the functions are executed, it can be seen through inspect-> sources-> snippets, here 
we can create a js file and see how the control flows through the code.
We can also add breakpoints in the code.
